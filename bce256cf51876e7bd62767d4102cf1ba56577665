      "message": "instead of manually downloading an archive would it be possible to simply pull a pre-built image by commit hash?\nI remember you mentioned the problem is that the image is not tagged, but it exists on Docker Hub\nif possible, I would prefer that approach a little bit better. easier to change it back once the image gets tagged",

      "message": "Sure, that was my original implementation for this, where we defined CENTOS_BASE as a docker ARG and set it in the spec file to \u0027centos:7.6...\u0027 for x86_64 and to \u0027centos@sh256:...\u0027 for aarch64.\n\nUnfortunately the sha256 hashes are separate for each image, so the x86_64 image would have a different sha256 than the aarch64 one; so we can\u0027t use a single `FROM centos@sha256:...`.\n\nIf that\u0027s the preffered approach and nobody objects, let me know and I will rebase all the  pending TA changes for AArch64 suppport to use this method.",
