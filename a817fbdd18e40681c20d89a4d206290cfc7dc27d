      "message": "This is actually the ugliest part of all these patches ...\nAnd that\u0027s only because the 7.6.1810 centos manifest does not list the arm64/v8 tag.\nMy hope was that they would release a new CentOS tag (note that :latest and :7 have proper arm64 support) which will make this hack obsolete.\n\nSo to avoid fragmentation and use the same release, we can either:\n- use FROM centos:7\n- wait for a new centos stable version tag with arm64 support (it might happen in the immediate future, I see some ongoing activity on dockerhub for the centos image pushes);",
